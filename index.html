      <p class="bio">My hobby is playing games and reading. I do these activities when free time.
         I am very happy playing the game because it can refresh my mind and make me more
         excited. I also like reading because through these activities I can get a variety
         of new knowledge.</p>
      <p class="bio"><strong class="tag">Short Story of My Life</strong> </p>
      <p class="bio">I will tell you about the things I have gone through in SMAKBO. In class X, I studied
         diligently. I always pray for fluency every learning process. During the exam, I worked
         on each question very well and I didn't cheat. When announcing the increase in class, it
         turned out that I became the overall champion. I'm very happy and my family is also proud.
         Besides, I have also participated in various competions.</p>
